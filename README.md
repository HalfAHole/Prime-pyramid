# Prime-pyramid
Console output of prime numbers in pyramid (lines limited by whole square numbers)

This program outputs all the natural numbers in a layout resembling a triangle/pyramid. The lines are limited by the whole squares ie 1,4,9,16,25,36....

I found out after I wrote this that this is called a Klauber Triangle.

The instructions for the programs use are in the code.

Enjoy.
